# (WIP) Typescript lexer and parser

Welcome to my TypeScript lexer and parser project! This is a learning journey where I dive deep into the mechanics of parsers and hone my intermediate Rust programming skills.

## Project vision

The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a programming language that is a subset of TypeScript. This language aims to leverage existing TypeScript tooling while delivering the performance benefits of a strongly typed language. Although this is an ambitious and challenging goal, I believe it presents a fascinating idea and a valuable learning experience.Feel free to explore, contribute, or provide feedback as I work towards making this vision a reality!
